                    <p>I am Espen, and I work as a Software Tester and Test Automation Engineer. I like to make things when I am not at work. 
                        Usually I make things out of wood in a workshop I have set up in my garage, but I occationally also make things out of code. 
                        This website is one of the things I have made using code. </p>

                I got my first computer in 1983. It was a Dragon 32, and I remember playing chess on it, and a game where the object was to dive for treasures without being eaten by sharks.
                I soon upgraded to a Commodore 128, and spent my childhood playing computer games and sharing the casette tapes(!) with friends. I was definately mostly a consumer of tech, 
                and didn't create much, neither code or woodworking. Although I remember trying to learn programming with a language called Turbo Pascal.<br><br>
                Ever since then, I have been very interested in technology and computers, but I never planned a carrer working in tech.<br><br>
                Instead I studied Psychology, Religion and Social Anthropology. I traveled to Asia and tried life as a Buddhist monk in Thailand and Bhutan<br><br>
                Eventually I managed to get a Masters degree in Social Anthropology, specializing in the topic of Buddhism in Bhutan.      
                <br><br>

                I was fortunate enough to be able to stay in this wonderful monastery in Bhutan called Tango Gompa. I lived there for a year, and sometimes still regret ever leaving.
                <br><br>
                After a brief return to Norway, I again went out to teach Social Anthropology and Religious Studies in southern India for a year. This was in 2004, the year of the terrible tsunami that destroyed the coastlines all over south Asia.
                <br><br>
                After returning to Norway with my wife, I started to work with resettlement of refugees. After a while I got involved with the development of software for the Norwegian Directorate of Integration and Diversity (Imdi). 
                <br><br>
                During my 11 years there I managed to get a Bachelors degree in Informatics from NTNU, and established the Test Manager position in Imdi. I started work as a Testing Consultant in Bouvet in 2019.

              <div>In this project I have practiced using APIs and JSON-data. Using the <a href="https://wheretheiss.at/w/developer">WhereTheIssAt API</a> 
                to get the current position of the International Space Station (ISS), and then using Google Maps Geolocation API to overlay the position on to the world map.
                It updates the position every 5 seconds, and over time draws a line marking the ISS flight path.

              <div>This is a desktop app made with Python and Tkinter. It is a basic encrytion app, that obscures and un-obscures a text message. 
                Not the most advanced cryptography, but fun to make and a challenging exploration of multi-dimentional arrays in Python.
                <br>
                I originally made this using VB.NET a long time ago, but thought it was a nice challenge to re-make it while learning Python.

              <div>This website is made using only HTML and CSS. This was a real challenge. 
                I had to go back to actually thinking about what I wanted the CSS to do, and why things were not looking the way I wanted them to.
                <br><br>
                I wanted to keep it simple, including the design. I chose a color palette with black, whitesmoke and grey, and a simple Arial font
                <br><br>It took some googleing, but I managed to make both the sticky menu, and these modals without resorting to javascript or css-libraries like Bootstrap

              <div>This game was one of the exercises in a javascript course I recently took. The point was to use jQuery to manipulate the DOM in various ways. 
                I dont particularily like to play this game, but I tried to make it a bit more interesting by adding difficulty-levels with hints.
